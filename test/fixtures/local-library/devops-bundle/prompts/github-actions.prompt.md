# GitHub Actions Workflow

Create efficient CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions.

## Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3

  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          # Deployment steps
```

## Best Practices

- Use caching to speed up workflows
- Run jobs in parallel when possible
- Use matrix strategy for multi-version testing
- Secure secrets with GitHub Secrets
- Add status badges to README
